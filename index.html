                    <h2>Forex</h2>
                    <p>The foreign exchange (also known as forex) market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies against one another. Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, and finance, forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset markets in the world. The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays. Currencies may still trade on a holiday if at least the country/global market is open for business.</p>

                    <h2>Stocks</h2>
                    <p>Stocks provide an ownership stake in a company. They provide access to company earnings based on its future performance. The returns from a stock over a specified holding period are the dividend payments it makes plus any capital gains or capital losses.</p>

                    <h2>Long Term Investment</h2>
                    <p>A long-term investment is an account on the asset side of a company's balance sheet that represents the company's investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Long-term investments are assets that a company intends to hold for more than a month.</p>

                    <h2>Day Trading</h2>
                    <p>Day trading is the act of buying and selling a financial instrument within the same day or even multiple times over the course of a day. Taking advantage of small price moves can be a lucrative game. You generate profit at a faster rate however the profit margins are smaller then if you were to do a long term investment.</p>
